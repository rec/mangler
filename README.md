# The poetry mangler

The poetry mangler is a collection of alleatoric text manipulators that I wrote
for [Abigail Child](https://www.abigailchild.com/) sometime before 2010

They are written in the  programming language [Perl](https://www.perl.org/)
aka the
[Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister](https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=27483).
